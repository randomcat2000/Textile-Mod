--VERY EARLY WIP--

mod that aims to add cotton and various cotton derived materials to BTA. <br />
currently implemented: <br />
cotton item, harvested from cotton plants<br />
cotton gin, obtainable with placeholder recipe <br />
cotton seeds, plants cotton plants, obtained with silly placeholder recipe <br />
cotton thread, crafts into cotton wool and string <br />
cotton wool, currently just a useless wool recolour <br />
cotton plant, functional, quite picky. be sure to grow in rows and in a warmer climate. grows best under the summer sun. <br />

planned:
- dyed cotton wool variants (and nonamedyes support once that updates to 7.1)\
- loom for further processing
- canvas (farmable leather substitute with other uses)
- denim (and wearables)
- kevlar
- hang gliders
- net/mesh (hold up falling blocks, semi-automated fishing, break long falls)
- carpet, similar to paintings but placeable on the ground or ceiling

pretty usable now (serves an ingame function/niche) but still in very early stages

requires HalpLibe 3.0.3 or above (https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/bta-halplibe)
