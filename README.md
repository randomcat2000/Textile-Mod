--VERY EARLY WIP--

mod that aims to add cotton and various cotton derived materials to BTA. <br />
currently implemented: <br />
cotton item, currently unobtainable <br />
cotton gin, obtainable with placeholder recipe <br />
cotton seeds, currently useless, planned to be used to plant cotton <br />
cotton thread, crafts into cotton wool and string <br />
cotton wool, currently just a useless wool recolour <br />
feel free to download and mess around with it if it's not broken, which it probably is <br />
